<a href="/[category]-converter.html">Prefixes Converter</a>

<a href="/[category]/[from]-to-[to].htm">kilometer to meter</a>

Instead of crawling recursively, crawling just first level and 2nd level and 3rd level seperately:

In first level, links looks like :
<a href="/[category]-converter.html">Prefixes Converter</a>

In 2nd level, links looks like :
<a href="/[category]/[from]-to-[to].htm">kilometer to meter</a>

For content to save
in top level crawl, there should be index.html and [category]/ dir 

in second level crawl,  
in [category]/ dir, there should be index.html and [from]-to-[to]/ dir 

In 3rd level crawl, 
In [from]-to-[to]/ dir, there should be index.html
